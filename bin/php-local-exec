#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# `php-local-exec` is a drop-in replacement for the standard PHP
# shebang line:
#
#    #!/usr/bin/env php-local-exec
#
# Use it for scripts inside a project with an `.phpenv-version`
# file. When you run the scripts, they'll use the project-specified
# PHP version, regardless of what directory they're run from. Useful
# for e.g. running project tasks in cron scripts without needing to
# `cd` into the project first.
